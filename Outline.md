## Goals

### Motivation for Adopting Post-Quantum Cryptography in Cloud-native Environments

The emergence of quantum computing represents both a technological breakthrough and a significant security challenge for modern cryptographic systems. Cloud-native environments, which form the backbone of today's digital infrastructure, are particularly vulnerable to these emerging threats due to their reliance on traditional cryptographic protocols. The motivation for adopting post-quantum cryptography in cloud-native environments stems from several critical factors:

1. **Quantum Computing Advancement**: The rapid development of quantum computing technology is approaching the threshold where it could break widely-used public-key cryptographic systems. While large-scale quantum computers are not yet publicly available, the technology holds great promise for benefiting society with faster solutions to difficult computational problems. However, this same computational power threatens the security foundations of our digital infrastructure.

2. **Long-term Data Protection**: Cloud environments store vast amounts of sensitive data that requires protection not just today, but for decades to come. Data encrypted with current methods may be captured now and decrypted later when quantum computers become powerful enough, a concept known as "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks. Implementing quantum-resistant encryption ensures that data remains secure throughout its lifecycle, regardless of future technological developments.

3. **Regulatory Compliance and Standards Evolution**: Government agencies and industry bodies are already developing new standards for post-quantum cryptography. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardized the first set of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including ML-KEM (formerly CRYSTALS-KYBER). Organizations that handle sensitive data will increasingly face regulatory requirements to implement quantum-resistant cryptography, making early adoption a strategic advantage.

4. **Infrastructure Modernization Opportunity**: The transition to post-quantum cryptography provides an opportunity to modernize cryptographic infrastructure, improving not only security but also performance, scalability, and manageability in cloud-native environments. This modernization aligns with broader digital transformation initiatives and cloud-native architectural principles.

5. **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations that proactively address quantum threats demonstrate security leadership and build trust with customers and partners. Early adopters gain valuable implementation experience and can offer enhanced security assurances compared to competitors.

### Protection of Sensitive Data Against Future Quantum Threats

The protection of sensitive data against future quantum threats is a paramount concern that drives the adoption of post-quantum cryptography. This protection encompasses several key dimensions:

1. **Neutralizing Shor's Algorithm Threat**: Quantum computers running Shor's algorithm can efficiently solve the mathematical problems underlying RSA and ECC cryptography, which form the basis of most current public key infrastructure. CRYSTALS-KYBER (ML-KEM) is specifically designed to resist attacks from quantum computers implementing Shor's algorithm, ensuring that encrypted data remains secure even in a post-quantum world.

2. **Preserving Confidentiality of Long-lived Secrets**: Many types of sensitive data require protection for extended periodsâ€”financial records, personal identifiable information, intellectual property, state secrets, and healthcare data. Post-quantum encryption ensures that this information remains confidential beyond the advent of practical quantum computing.

3. **Securing Critical Infrastructure**: Cloud-native storage systems often support critical infrastructure applications in sectors like energy, transportation, and healthcare. Protecting these systems against quantum threats is essential for national and economic security, as well as public safety.

4. **Maintaining Digital Trust**: The integrity of digital signatures, authentication systems, and non-repudiation mechanisms is fundamental to trust in digital transactions. Quantum-resistant algorithms ensure that these trust mechanisms remain reliable in a post-quantum era.

5. **Addressing Supply Chain Security**: Modern supply chains rely on secure communication and data storage across multiple cloud environments. Quantum-resistant encryption protects the integrity of these supply chains against sophisticated future attacks.

6. **Ensuring Business Continuity**: A sudden breakthrough in quantum computing could create an urgent security crisis for unprepared organizations. Proactive implementation of post-quantum cryptography ensures business continuity by eliminating the need for emergency cryptographic transitions under duress.

By implementing CRYSTALS-KYBER encryption for cloud-native storage, organizations can confidently store and process sensitive data with the assurance that it will remain protected against both current threats and the emerging capabilities of quantum computers. This forward-looking approach to data security aligns with best practices in risk management and demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data protection in an evolving technological landscape.

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Layered Security Model**: The solution employs a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of cryptographic protection. ML-KEM serves as the quantum-resistant foundation for key exchange, while symmetric encryption algorithms (such as AES-256) provide the bulk data encryption. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both cryptographic paradigms.

2. **Microservices-Based Design**: The cryptographic services are implemented as containerized microservices that can be deployed, scaled, and managed using cloud-native orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. This approach ensures flexibility, resilience, and efficient resource utilization across diverse cloud environments.

RESTful and gRPC interfaces provide standardized methods for key management, encryption, decryption, and cryptographic operations, allowing for easy adoption across different systems.

4. **Stateless Operation Model**: The cryptographic services operate in a stateless manner, with keys and cryptographic state stored in secure, distributed key management systems. This approach enhances scalability and resilience while simplifying operations in dynamic cloud environments.

5. **Pluggable Algorithm Framework**: While ML-KEM is the primary post-quantum algorithm, the architecture supports a pluggable framework that can accommodate additional NIST-approved algorithms as they become standardized. This future-proofs the solution against evolving cryptographic standards and threats.

6. **Transparent Encryption Layer**: For storage applications, the solution implements transparent encryption that operates at the storage layer, requiring minimal changes to existing applications. This approach facilitates adoption while maintaining backward compatibility.

7. **Observability and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities provide visibility into cryptographic operations, performance, and security events. This observability is essential for maintaining security assurance and operational excellence in cloud environments.

8. **Automated Key Rotation and Management**: The architecture includes automated mechanisms for key generation, distribution, rotation, and revocation, following cryptographic best practices while minimizing operational overhead.

4. **Hybrid Mode Operation**: The solution implements ML-KEM in a hybrid mode alongside traditional cryptography (such as ECDH), providing a defense-in-depth approach that maintains security even if vulnerabilities are discovered in either cryptographic family.

5. **Key Encapsulation Mechanism**: As a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), ML-KEM is specifically designed for securely establishing shared symmetric keys, which are then used for bulk data encryption. This approach leverages the strengths of both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography.

6. **Implementation Optimizations**: The solution includes optimized implementations of ML-KEM that leverage hardware acceleration where available, including AVX2 vector instructions on modern processors. These optimizations ensure that the post-quantum cryptography adds minimal performance overhead.

7. **Side-Channel Resistance**: The implementation incorporates countermeasures against side-channel attacks, ensuring that the cryptographic operations do not leak sensitive information through timing, power consumption, or other side channels.
