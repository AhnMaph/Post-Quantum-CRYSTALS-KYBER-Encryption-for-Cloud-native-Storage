## Project Background

### Problem Statement

Modern cryptographic systems that secure our digital infrastructure face an existential threat from the advancement of quantum computing. Traditional public-key cryptography algorithms such as RSA and ECC rely on mathematical problems that are computationally infeasible for classical computers but can be efficiently solved by quantum computers using Shor's algorithm. This vulnerability creates a critical security risk for cloud storage systems, which contain vast amounts of sensitive data protected by these potentially vulnerable cryptographic methods.

The "harvest now, decrypt later" attack vector is particularly concerning, where adversaries collect encrypted data today with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computing capabilities mature. For cybersecurity students, understanding and implementing quantum-resistant cryptography represents both an educational opportunity and a chance to develop skills in an emerging area of critical importance to the field.

This student project addresses the need for practical experience with post-quantum cryptography, specifically focusing on CRYSTALS-KYBER (now standardized as ML-KEM), which has been selected by NIST as the primary standard for quantum-resistant key encapsulation. By implementing a proof-of-concept system for cloud storage protection, students will gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge cryptographic techniques while developing a practical understanding of security implementation challenges.

### Quantum Computing Threat

The quantum computing threat to cryptography is evolving rapidly, with several key developments increasing the urgency of transition to post-quantum algorithms:

Quantum computing capabilities are advancing faster than initially predicted. IBM, Google, and other technology leaders have demonstrated increasingly powerful quantum systems, with error-corrected quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm potentially available within the next decade. The timeline for quantum threats has compressed, with some experts now predicting that cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge within 5-10 years.

The standardization of post-quantum cryptography has progressed significantly, with NIST completing its first round of standardization. CRYSTALS-KYBER (now ML-KEM) has been selected as the primary key encapsulation mechanism standard, providing a solid foundation for implementation. This standardization reduces implementation risk and provides confidence in the security properties of selected algorithms.

For cybersecurity students, understanding these threats and the corresponding countermeasures is becoming an essential part of a comprehensive education. Practical experience with post-quantum cryptography implementation provides valuable skills that will be increasingly in demand as organizations begin transitioning to quantum-resistant security approaches.

### CRYSTALS-KYBER Overview

CRYSTALS-KYBER, now standardized as ML-KEM (Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism), is a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm selected by NIST as the primary standard for quantum-resistant key encapsulation. Understanding its key characteristics is essential for this student project:

ML-KEM is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. This mathematical foundation provides strong security assurances against both classical and quantum attacks, including Shor's algorithm which threatens traditional public-key cryptography.

The algorithm defines three primary operations:
1. Key Generation: Creates a public/private key pair
2. Encapsulation: Uses the recipient's public key to encapsulate a shared secret, producing a ciphertext
3. Decapsulation: Uses the recipient's private key to recover the shared secret from the ciphertext

For this student project, several aspects of ML-KEM are particularly advantageous:
- Open-source reference implementations are available, providing a starting point for student implementation
- The algorithm has clear specifications and test vectors for validation
- The key encapsulation mechanism integrates well with hybrid cryptographic approaches
- The standardization provides clear documentation and resources for implementation

These characteristics make ML-KEM an ideal candidate for a student project, allowing for meaningful implementation within a 2-month timeframe while providing exposure to advanced cryptographic concepts.

### Educational Value
